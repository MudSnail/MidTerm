# MidTerm
Lighthouse Labs midterm project.

### Problem: 
Historicailly crimes have been decreasing in New York City. However our main question is where police resources are most needed during major events like pandemics. 

Therefore, we used NYPD historical crime data to create two periods of time: Pre-Covid (March 2019 to end of Feburary 2020) and Covid (March 2020 to end of Feburary 2021). Then used these period of time to compare how crimes changed from pre-covid to post-covid in New York City. 

We tackled the problem by acting as consultants for the NYPD.

### Goal: 
Our main goal is to use EDA, statistics and clustering in order to make suggestions on what the NYPD can change in order to focus their resources available to them. The focus of resources may change focus during stricter periods of time or times that may be considered a crisis (ie. pandemics).
